# Student Performance Analytics Dashboard 📊

This project is a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for analyzing student lifestyle
and academic performance data. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with
machine learning models to understand performance patterns and stress levels in students.

## Project Overview
The application allows users to explore student lifestyle factors such as sleep,
study hours, physical activity, and social habits, and see how they relate to CGPA
and stress levels. Simple machine learning models are used for prediction and analysis.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with interactive charts
- CGPA prediction using regression models
- Stress level classification using machine learning
- Interactive Streamlit user interface
- Downloadable datasets and trained models

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available student lifestyle datasets containing information
such as sleep hours, study hours, physical activity, GPA/CGPA, and stress levels.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Streamlit application:
```streamlit run app.py```
The application will open in your browser at:
http://localhost:8501


## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with data analysis and visualization
- Understanding regression and classification models
- Building interactive ML applications using Streamlit
- End-to-end ML workflow from data preprocessing to deployment

## Note
This project is created for learning and demonstration purposes using public datasets.
